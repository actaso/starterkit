# Tech Stack
For web and mobile projects we have a default stack of technology we prefer to use. This is based on the T3Stack Turbo (thanks Theo, https://github.com/t3-oss/create-t3-turbo).

## Tech used
- NextJs for the web application + api backend (deployed through vercel)
- Tailwind for styling, shadcn for default components
- Expo for native mobile apps
- Tauri for native desktop apps
- Posthog for analytics
- Betterstack for tracing, observability & monitoring
- Modal for AI inference and serverless GPU
- Neon for postgres db
- Mintlify for docs
- Firebase (if there is a good reason for us to use this)
- Clerk or BetterAuth for auth

## Other
- We work in monorepos.
