# Startup Playbook

Startups can be confusing and chaotic, but they don't need to be. This playbook articulates the "science" of building a company that works. Use this as orientation while leaving room to figure out the "art."

## Startup = Engine

Think of your startup as an engine. You can map everything required to reach your destination as outputs of the engine you're executing. The foundational elements are similar across companies.

Consider your startup engine in terms of generations, with growth metrics as thresholds between stages. There are roughly 3 generations:

0. Finding initial PMF (0 → $10k MRR)  
1. Scaling your core market ($10k → $1M MRR)  
2. Scaling to new markets ($1M → $10M+ MRR)

These are rough approximations. Don't treat them as gospel—use them as orientation for your mental model.

This document focuses exclusively on Stage 0.

## Stage 0: Finding Initial PMF

We assume you understand product-market fit ([watch this if not](https://www.ycombinator.com/library/5z-the-real-product-market-fit)). Your only goal: find initial PMF before you run out of money. Act with urgency or your company dies before you start.

### How to Find PMF (The Engine):

1. **Define your value proposition** (we help X do Y by providing Z)
2. **Build the complete funnel** (landing page → signup → onboarding → activation → retention) and track every metric
3. **Add an onboarding survey** with open text fields for richer data:
   - Who signed up?
   - Why did they sign up?
   - Phone number for follow-up
4. **Implement a paywall with free trial** to validate your repeatable business model
5. **Schedule customer calls** within days of signup
6. **Listen for specifics** - focus on the root of their problems, not surface complaints
7. **Iterate after ~30 signups** - revisit your value proposition and formulate a hypothesis to test



**The key insight:** Think of your company as a series of experiments. Without intentional learning, you'll chase your tail. The *cycle time of iterations* and *quality of experiments* determine your speed to success. Optimize both vectors.
